-My main aim of this project is to present how it is possible to build scalable and extendable web applications with the help of the latest technologies. The main reasons were enclosed:

-Gain Mastery: Depict my capability to connect Angular with Firebase, incorporating main attributes that are fundamental elements in web development.

-Demonstrate Real-Time Application: Through the use of Angular's component-based architecture and Firebase's real-time database functionalities, I will make it more specific and comprehensible.

-Responsive Design: The design is flexible and can be changed according to the screen size, I used Bootstrap as it is a powerful tool that helps to write the code quickly and simply making the website very easy to work on.

#Key Contributions

-Full-Stack Development: This one of real projects uses a dual backend operation where the front-end is for users, and the back-end is for workers that responsible for project process and transactions in it.

-Technical Implementation: Authenticinally, I build the angular services and connect them to the real-time Firebase Database. And also constructed the database to become the real-time data feedback.
